# Final Optimization Summary

## Performance Improvements Implemented

### 1. ParticleField Component Optimization
- **Reduced particle count**: From 250 to 100 particles to decrease CPU load
- **Added frame rate limiting**: Capped animations at 60 FPS to prevent excessive rendering
- **Implemented throttling**: For scroll and resize events to reduce re-renders
- **Optimized animation loop**: More efficient particle lifecycle management

### 2. Preloader Component Optimization
- **Replaced styled-components**: With CSS classes to reduce re-renders
- **Simplified animations**: Removed complex CSS animations for better performance

### 3. General Performance Optimizations
- **Dynamic imports**: For heavy components to improve initial load time
- **React.memo**: Added to components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Event listener throttling**: For scroll and resize events
- **Code splitting**: For routes and heavy components

### 4. Image Optimization
- **Next.js Image component**: Used throughout the application for automatic optimization
- **Loading attributes**: Added for better resource management

### 5. Bundle Size Optimization
- **Dynamic imports**: For heavy libraries like Three.js, GSAP, and Framer Motion
- **Code splitting**: To reduce initial bundle size

### 6. CSS Optimization
- **will-change property**: Added for animated elements
- **Transform and opacity**: Used for animations instead of expensive properties
- **Hardware acceleration**: Enabled with transform: translateZ(0)

### 7. Next.js Configuration Optimization
- **Webpack optimizations**: Enabled top-level await and split chunks
- **Image optimization**: Configured minimum cache TTL

### 8. Performance Monitoring
- **Custom hook**: Created usePerformanceMonitor for tracking key metrics
- **PerformanceObserver**: Implemented to track FCP, LCP, CLS, FID, and TTFB
