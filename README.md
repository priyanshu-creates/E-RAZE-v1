This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## New Features

This project has been enhanced with several new UI components:

### ShineBorder Component
An animated background border effect that adds a dynamic, eye-catching shine to any element. The animation has been tuned for a sleek, sophisticated appearance with slower timing.

### Enhanced Download Page
The download page now features:
- TiltedCard (3D tilt effect)
- StarBorder (Rotating star border effect)
- ShineBorder (Animated shine effect with sophisticated 12-second timing)
- All three effects combined for a rich, interactive user experience

### Demo Pages
- `/shine-demo` - Dedicated shine border demo
- `/combined-demo` - All effects working together
- `/animation-test` - Verify the shine border animation is working correctly with different speeds
