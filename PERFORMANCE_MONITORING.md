# Performance Monitoring Guide

This guide explains how to monitor the performance of the application after implementing optimizations.

## Browser Developer Tools

### Chrome DevTools Performance Tab
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12 or right-click → Inspect)
2. Go to the "Performance" tab
3. Click the record button (●)
4. Interact with your application
5. Stop recording and analyze the results

Key metrics to watch:
- **FPS (Frames Per Second)**: Should be consistently 60 FPS
- **CPU Usage**: Should not spike excessively
- **Memory Usage**: Should not continuously increase (memory leaks)
- **Long Tasks**: Should be minimized

### Firefox Performance Tab
1. Open Firefox Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the "Performance" tab
3. Click the record button
4. Interact with your application
5. Stop recording and analyze the results

## Lighthouse Audits

### Running Lighthouse
1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to the "Lighthouse" tab
3. Select categories to audit (Performance, Best Practices, SEO, etc.)
4. Click "Generate report"

Key performance metrics:
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**
- **First Input Delay (FID)**
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**

## Custom Performance Monitoring

The application includes a custom performance monitoring hook (`usePerformanceMonitor`) that tracks:

- Navigation timing
- Paint timing (FCP, LCP)
- Layout shifts (CLS)
- First input delay (FID)
- User timing measures

To view these metrics:
1. Open the browser's console (F12 → Console tab)
2. Look for "Performance Entry" log messages
3. These entries contain detailed timing information

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Target Metrics
- **FCP**: < 1.8 seconds
- **LCP**: < 2.5 seconds
- **FID**: < 100 milliseconds
- **CLS**: < 0.1
- **TBT**: < 200 milliseconds

### Frame Rate
- **Target**: 60 FPS consistently
- **Minimum acceptable**: 30 FPS for animations

### Bundle Size
- **Target**: < 200 KB for main bundle
- **Monitoring**: Check in Network tab of DevTools

## Monitoring Animation Performance

### CSS Animations
1. Use the "Rendering" tab in Chrome DevTools
2. Enable "Paint flashing" to see areas that are being repainted
3. Enable "Layout Shift Regions" to see layout shifts

### JavaScript Animations
1. Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations
2. Avoid forcing synchronous layout (offsetTop, offsetLeft, etc.)
3. Use transforms and opacity for animations when possible

## Memory Leak Detection

### Chrome DevTools Memory Tab
1. Take heap snapshots before and after interactions
2. Look for growing memory usage over time
3. Check for detached DOM elements

### Common Memory Leak Sources
- Event listeners not removed
- Intervals/timeouts not cleared
- Closures holding references to large objects
- Console logs of large objects

## Network Performance

### Chrome DevTools Network Tab
1. Check for large assets
2. Verify proper caching headers
3. Look for render-blocking resources
4. Check for failed requests

### Optimization Techniques
- Image optimization (WebP format, proper sizing)
- Code splitting
- Caching strategies
- CDN usage

## Mobile Performance

### Mobile-Specific Considerations
- Touch event handling
- Battery usage
- Network conditions
- Screen size variations

### Testing on Mobile
- Use Chrome DevTools Device Mode
- Test on actual devices
- Use WebPageTest.org for real device testing

## Performance Budget

### Recommended Limits
- **JavaScript**: < 200 KB compressed
- **CSS**: < 50 KB compressed
- **Images**: < 1 MB total
- **Fonts**: < 50 KB each
- **Total Assets**: < 2 MB

## Continuous Monitoring

### Automated Testing
- Integrate Lighthouse CI in your deployment pipeline
- Set up performance budgets in webpack
- Use tools like Calibre or SpeedCurve for ongoing monitoring

### Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- Implement performance monitoring in production
- Track Core Web Vitals in the field
- Set up alerts for performance degradation

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

### Common Issues and Solutions
1. **Low FPS**
   - Reduce DOM complexity
   - Optimize animations (use transform/opacity)
   - Implement frame rate limiting

2. **High Memory Usage**
   - Remove event listeners
   - Clear intervals/timeouts
   - Avoid memory leaks in closures

3. **Slow Load Times**
   - Optimize images
   - Implement code splitting
   - Use proper caching

4. **Layout Shifts**
   - Reserve space for images and ads
   - Avoid inserting content above existing content
   - Use transform instead of changing layout properties

## Tools and Resources

### Browser Tools
- Chrome DevTools Performance Tab
- Firefox Profiler
- Safari Web Inspector

### Online Tools
- Lighthouse CI
- WebPageTest.org
- PageSpeed Insights
- GTmetrix

### Libraries
- Web Vitals (for measuring Core Web Vitals)
- Perfume.js (for advanced performance monitoring)
- Bundlesize (for monitoring bundle sizes)

By following this guide and regularly monitoring these metrics, you can ensure that the application maintains its "buttery smooth" performance.
