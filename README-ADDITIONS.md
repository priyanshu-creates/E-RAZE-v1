### Basic ShineBorder

  borderWidth={2} 
  duration={12} 
  shineColor="#7fe200"
  className="rounded-lg"
>
  <div>Content with shine border</div>
</ShineBorder>
```

### Multi-color ShineBorder
```tsx
<ShineBorder 
  borderWidth={2} 
  duration={15} 
  shineColor={["#ff00aa", "#00a2ff", "#7fe200"]}
  className="rounded-lg"
>
  <div>Content with rainbow shine border</div>
</ShineBorder>
```

## Integration with Existing Components

The ShineBorder component works seamlessly with:
- TiltedCard (3D tilt effect)
- StarBorder (Rotating star border effect)
- Any other React component

All three effects can be combined for a rich, interactive user experience.

## Animation Timing

For a sophisticated appearance:
- **Very Slow (12-15 seconds)**: Most elegant and subtle
- **Slow (8-12 seconds)**: Sleek and sophisticated
- **Medium (6-8 seconds)**: Balanced between elegance and visibility

The download cards use a 12-second duration for a sleek, sophisticated appearance.

## Troubleshooting

If you're not seeing the animation:

1. **Check the duration**: We've adjusted the duration to 8-12 seconds for a more sophisticated appearance
2. **Visit the animation test page**: Go to `/animation-test` to verify the animation is working
3. **Refresh the page**: Sometimes a simple refresh can resolve animation issues
